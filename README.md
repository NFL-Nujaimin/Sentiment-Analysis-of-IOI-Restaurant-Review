# Sentiment-Analysis-of-IOI-Restaurant-Review

## Introduction

This repository hosts the project on sentiment analysis of customer reviews for five distinguished restaurants in IOI City Mall, Putrajaya. The aim is to utilize advanced natural language processing techniques to categorize reviews into positive or negative sentiments, providing actionable insights for restaurant managers to enhance customer satisfaction and service quality.

## Problem Statement

Online reviews significantly influence dining and shopping decisions. However, restaurant owners face challenges in sifting through numerous varied reviews, which complicates understanding of customer satisfaction and identification of areas for improvement. This project addresses these issues by systematically analyzing and visualizing the sentiments expressed in customer reviews.

## Project Scope

- Focus: Sentiment analysis of 1000 to 2000 Google reviews per restaurant within IOI City Mall.
- Objective: Categorize feedback to better understand customer experiences and provide a visualization of sentiment analysis scores.
- Tools Used: Selenium for web scraping, BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML, NLTK for natural language processing, TextBlob and VADER for sentiment analysis.

## Data Collection

Data is collected using Selenium and BeautifulSoup by navigating to Google Maps reviews pages, extracting, and parsing review content, then storing this data for analysis.

## Analysis 

Sentiment analysis is performed using TextBlob and VADER tools, classifying reviews into positive, neutral, or negative categories. This includes a comparative evaluation of tool performance through accuracy scores and precision metrics.

## Visualization 

Visualization of the sentiment analysis is facilitated through PowerBI, presenting an intuitive representation of sentiment distribution across the reviewed restaurants. The visualization are shown below.
